# File Types & Importance  

JSON has the advantage of super-easy parsing in JavaScript, though you'll probably have to find and introduce a library in other languages.

XML has the advantage of more common usage across languages, useful for the storage you mention; and also valuable for passing around through different systems.

YAML has libraries for all languages, but is somewhat less commonly used, so you are more likely to have to find and introduce a library; whereas XML libraries are more commonly bundled, and JSON is automatically parseable in JavaScript.

For small, lightweight apps author  personally think XML is overkill , author says that he  prefer YAML in that case. for interaction with javascript use json. If you truly need to define your own grammar (read: schema) then xml is it.

# Why Python &  yaml to json 
I would like to choose python.I would like to  convert yml to json .
Because Python is an easy to use language which has awesome libraries that work very well . 
And   yml is light-weight and well-suited for hierarchical data representation, it also has a compact syntax for relational data

in general, a JSON expression is going to be 30% smaller than "equivalent" XML. 



### YAML To JSON : 


Technically YAML is a superset of JSON. This means that, in theory at least, a YAML parser can understand JSON, but not necessarily the other way around.

In general, there are certain features have  YAML that are not available in JSON.

As @jdupont pointed out, YAML is visually easier to look at. In fact the YAML homepage is itself valid YAML, yet it is easy for a human to read.
YAML has the ability to reference other items within a YAML file using "anchors." Thus it can handle relational information as one might find in a MySQL database.
YAML is more robust about embedding other serialization formats such as JSON or XML within a YAML file.
Right now, AJAX and other web technologies tend to use JSON. YAML is currently being used more for offline data processes.




### YAML To JSON Using python  : 

~~~
import yaml
import json
 
yml = """
---
  foo: bar
"""
data = yaml.load(yml)
json = json.dumps(data)
 
print(json)

# SQLite database data and convert it to JSON.

import sys
import sqlite3
import json

try:

    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

    # This enables column access by name: row['column_name']

    curs.execute("INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2008-03-06','HOLD','IBM',200,45.2)")

    # Commit the inserted rows.
    conn.commit()

    # Now fetch back the inserted data and write it to JSON.
    curs.execute("SELECT * FROM stocks")

    print rows_json

except Exception, e:
    print "ERROR: Caught exception: " + repr(e)
    raise e
    sys.exit(1)
